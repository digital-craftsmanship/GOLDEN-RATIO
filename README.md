# GOLDEN RATIO
 
A collection of learning materials for creative programming, connecting math, processing and Digital Craftsmanship.

##The plan 
To have eight topics, each with some learning materials.
We will publish a video lecture about each.
It is organised as a course, so the first lecture is named DAY 1 COORDINATE-SYSTEMS

##Background
The learning materials arose from a course called **Golden Ratio** taught at TU/e by Loe Feijs, Christoph Bartneck, Jun Hu and Matthias Funk in the period 2008-2018. Some elements are also used in another course, **Digital Craftsmanship** by Kristina Andersen and Loe Feijs.
